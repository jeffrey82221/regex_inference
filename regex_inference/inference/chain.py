I demand you to alter each regex and show each altered regex as answer.

The criteria for each altered regex is that:
1. The altered regex should still correctly match the patterns that is correctly match.
2. The altered regex should exclude the pattern mistakenly matched. That is, those mistakenly match patterns should not be matched.


Note that:
1. The regex before and after the alteration should be double quoted.
2. The regex before and after the alteration should be shown line-by-line.
3. The regex before and after the alteration should be listed in the same line.
4. The regex before and after the alteration should be separated by "," mark.
5. Do not show any additional text besides regex.
6. In the answer, the regex before the alteration should not be different from those provided in Fact 0.

An example to the answer is:

"original_regex_1","altered_regex_1"
"original_regex_2","altered_regex_2"
"original_regex_3","altered_regex_3"
